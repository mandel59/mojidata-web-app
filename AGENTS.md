# AGENTS.md

- Use **Jujutsu VCS** for version control and commits.  
- Include agent and model details in the commit-message trailers.  
  Example:  

  ```text
  Generated-by: Codex (GPT-5.2, reasoning: high)
  ```

- When creating multi-line commit messages, do **not** pass `\n` escapes to `jj commit -m` (they will be recorded literally).  
  Use `$'...'` or a heredoc to include real newlines, e.g.:

  ```sh
  jj commit -m $'Subject line\n\nGenerated-by: Codex (GPT-5.2, reasoning: high)'
  ```

- When running shell commands, **quote file paths** (prefer single quotes) to avoid `zsh` interpreting special characters and expansions.  
  In particular, quote paths containing whitespace or any of these characters/features:
  - Globs: `*`, `?`, `[]`, `()`, `^`, `#`, `~` (zsh glob operators / qualifiers)
  - Brace expansion: `{}`, e.g. `{a,b}`
  - Tilde expansion: `~` (especially at the start of a path)
  - Parameter/command/history expansion: `$...`, `$(...)`, `` `...` ``, `!`
  - Redirection / control operators: `<`, `>`, `|`, `&`, `;`
  Tip: use `--` before path arguments when supported (e.g. `rg -- 'src/app/[lang]/...'`).  
  Example: `sed -n '1,20p' 'src/app/[lang]/search/page.tsx'`

- Sandbox/approval note: in restricted environments, these typically require permission escalation:
  - `jj commit` (needs to write to `.git/objects` to create commit objects)
  - Integration tests that start local servers / bind ports (e.g. Vite) or launch browsers (e.g. Playwright)
